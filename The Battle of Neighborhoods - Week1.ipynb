    "England has been the cradle of diverse rock artists and bands that have changed the  musical scene worlwide. From psychedelic to indie, passing trough progressive and punk, british rock has contributed to a great variety of styles and still has a great influence in present mainstream and underground scene. That's why music lovers arrive every year to visit historical music places, go to concerts and enjoy nightlife. \n",
    "But, what are the musical preferences of every city in England? I'll draft this by clasifying the main artists and rock bands representing every musical genre and identifying its origin city. This would help tourists keen on music to define the best cities to visit, event promoters to set the city to organize a concert and entrepreunors to start a business on music.\n",
    "For this project purposes, I'll focus on the point of view of an entrepreunor who is interested in starting a Bandeoke business pointed to underground music (punk and post-punk). Once the best city is selected, in terms of its musical taste, I'll explore the neighborhoods in it to choice the best to set the location of the Bandeoke.\n"
