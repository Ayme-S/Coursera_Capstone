    "In this project, in the absence of better information, the musical tastes in England cities have been derived from their musical style production. This could be misleading, as it's a lot much easier to create songs that rarely exceed two minutes (some varieties of punk) than to create really musical masterpieces (some musical pieces of progressive rock). But virtuosity and complexity rejection is something that also must be taken into account. Some people just prefer easy-listening music, otherwise, classical music would be the popular one. For these reasons, despite some pitfalls, it can be considered that musical production is a good indicator of musical preferences, and in this sense, Manchester most prefers punk, new wave, alternative and indie rock.
